# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Dashboard
This is my Second Power Bi Project. 
Hey, Everyone I have recently completed my another Dashboard 'Titanic Survival Prediction' Analysis. I have created this dashboard using Excel and Power BI.
🚀OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:-
Using dataset to build a Dashboard that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
🚀TOOLS USED FOR CREATING THIS DASHBOARD:-
Excel and Power BI.
🚀To achieve the goal of this Project ,I have followed the several Procedures :-
-Firstly understanding the Provided Dataset by Afame Technologies .
-Then I performed data cleaning (in excel) to remove duplicates ,spacing ,special characters, find and replace function and formatting.
-Created custom columns (Age Brackets) to extract additional information from the dataset.
-Export Clean data to Power BI for making a dashboard .
-Used appropriate visuals to summarize the data and make it easier to understand.
-Finally, I built a dashboard in Power BI with slicers, which allows users to interact with the data and view it in different ways.

🚀Key Insights:-
📢There were total 891 passengers. Out of which 342 Passengers were survived and 549 Passengers died.
📢Average Age of Passengers is 30 and average fare is $32.
📢The Male Passengers were having highest survival count as compared to female passengers by 263.
📢The Survival Rate Among Seniors is lowest and children is almost lowest.
📢Third Class is having the highest survival Rate by 491.
